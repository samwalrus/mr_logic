<h1>Mendelian Randomization as a Probabilistic Logic Program </h1>
This interactive notebook demonstrates Mendelian Randomization as a Probabilistic Logic Program. 
We aim to demonstrate some examples of using this formalism first, and then give some background information on the formalism later. 

Throughout this note book we will use a number of artificial running examples. In the first example we will define the relationships between a SNP, a metabolite (that can take on values 0 or 1) and having a high Body Mass Index (BMI).
<p>
We first set up our program by importing the required libray and initialsing it (line 1 and 2).
 In this note book we are using the approixmate algorithms provided by the mcantyre library [CITE]. 
We then state that our probalistic program will begin (line 3) and on line 4 we state that someone has either the genotype value <i>aa</i> or <i>ab</i> with equal probabilty.

The following causal theory is made from four causal laws (on lines 1,2, 4 &amp; 5).
It describes a set causal relationships between the genotype, the metabolite and having a high BMI.
It states if a person has the <i>aa</i> genotype, this will cause them to have the metabolite with value <i>1</i> with probabilty 0.7 or the value of the metabolite of <i>0</i> with probabilty 0.3 (line 1).
If they have the alternative genotype <i>ab</i>, this will instead cause them to have metabolite with value <i>1</i> with probabilty 0.2 or the value of the metabolite of <i>1</i> with probabilty 0.8 (line 2).

Regardless of the value of the genotype, if a person has metabolite version <i>e</i>, then this will cause them to have a high BMI (Value 1) with a probabilty of 0.6 or low BMI (Value 0) with probabilty 0.4 (line 4).
Alternativly if they have the <i>l</i> version of the metabolite, this will cause them to have a high BMI (Value 1) with probabilty of 0.3 or low BMI (Value 0) with probabilty 0.7 (line5). 
<p> Note: The connective operator <i>:-</i> is standard logic programing syntax and is intended to represent an arrow for logical implication.</p>

The next box gives an alternative causal theory. Which has a differnt set of causal releanthips between the SNP, the metabolite and the state of having high BMI.
In this theroy having the <i>aa</i> genotype causes a person to have the metabolite <i>1</i> with probabilty 0.6 or <i>0</i> with probabilty 0.3. 
However if they have the <i>ab</i> genotype this will cause them to have metabolite value <i>1</i> with probabilty 0.4 or metabolite value <i>0</i> with probabilty 0.6.

In contrast to the first causal theory, in this theory the state of having a high BMI is causaly effected by the relationship between the genotype and the value of the metabolite.
Line 4, states that when a person has a metabolite <i>1</i> and genotype <i>ab</i> they will a high BMI with probabilty 0.
Line 5, states that when a person has metabolite version <i>1</i> but the genotype aa this will cause them to have a high BMI with probabilty 0.6.
Line 6, states that when a person has metabolite version <i>0</i> and the <i>ab</i> genotype this will cause them to have a high BMI with probabilty 0.4.
Lastly, line 7 states that with <i>0</i> and <i>aa</i>, this will cause high BMI with probabilty 0.5

In the next box we give a third causal theory. 
In this theory it can be clearly seen that there is no causal law effecting BMI from the metobolite value.
Instead, in line 1 we state that 50% of people eat cheese.
Line 3 and line 4 give the intial value of the metabolite caused by the genotype.

Line 6 and gives the causal law that if someone does not eat cheese there met value stays the same.
Line 7 states that if a person eats cheese, and there metabolic value caused by the genotype is 0, then there top up value of the metabolite is 1.
 and that eating cheese causes a high BMI with probabilty 0.7 (line 6) and causes metabolie 1 with probabilty 0.8 (line 7).
Eating cheese is an independent cause of metabolite 1. 
Someone could have both metabolites according to this theory, because there genotype would allow them to have value 0 and there cheese consumption would allow them to have value 1.

In the first theory there is no causal law where the genotype directly causes the. It therefore is compatible with MR and IV. To determine the causal effect of the allele on the prob of x. We can calculate q.

We can verify that the value of the metabolite is associated with the value of genotype.

We can reason about our causals theories to calculate probabilities of interventions. This is analogous to pearls do operator. We remove the first two laws and replace with a law. If we do this to both causal theories then we can now see how the probabilities are now differnt in the tow modified theories.

  Making an intervention on the metabolite does not change a probabilty of getting high bmi.

CP-Logic is a differnt formalism to Causal Baysain Networks which are often used in MR. Some of the differnces are: 1.2.3.4.

The full details of this formalism its capabilties and limitations are to detailed to fit in this poster and we refer the reader to the litrature. The aim of this poster/notebook is bring this formalism to the attention of MR researchers and to show that this alternative formalism brings differnt capabilites and expressivness to knowledge represention required of MR. This can be explored in further work.
