<h1> Abductive Reasoning and Mendilian Randomisation </h1>

<p> This notebook gives a simplified account of the reasoning that smoking causes bladder cancer using evidence that a persons genetics exersbates the risk factor</p><p>

<p></p><p> </p><blockquote> Model B (Fig. 1) can also be illustrated by the influence of
smoking tobacco on bladder cancer risk. Observational studies
suggest an association, but clearly confounding and a variety of
biases could generate such an association. The potential carcinogens in tobacco smoke relevant to bladder cancer risk include
aromatic and heterocyclic amines, which are detoxified by
N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2). Genetic variation in the NAT2
gene leads to slower or faster acetylation states. If particular carcinogens in tobacco smoke do increase the risk of bladder cancer,
then it would be expected that those with slow acetylate states,
who have a reduced rate of detoxification of these carcinogens,
would be at an increased risk of bladder cancer if they were smokers, whereas if they were not exposed to these carcinogens (the
major exposure route for those outside of particular industries
being through tobacco smoke) then an association of genotype
  with bladder cancer risk would not be anticipated. The influence of the NAT2 slow acetylation genotype is only appreciable among those also exposed to
smoking. As the genotype will be unrelated to confounders, it is
difficult to reason why this situation should arise unless smoking
is a causal factor with respect to bladder cancer. Thus, the presence of a sizable effect of genotype in the exposed group, but not
in the unexposed group, provides evidence as to the causal nature
of the environmentally modifiable risk factorâ€”in this example,
smoking.</blockquote> [1] Mendelian Randomization for
