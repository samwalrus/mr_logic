Epidemiologists research the causes of diseases and methodologies to help find and verify these causes. State of the art methods to find causes have been developed in Bristol, for example Mendelian Randomisation (MR). This method for assessing potential causal risk factors uses the naturally occuring randomisation of genes at conception to mimic randomised control trials. MR can be described using graphical models that connect variables of interest with edges labeled with observed associations between these variables. Certain logical structures of these graphs can be interpreted as evidence for causation. For example paths with certain properties or connectedness between certain variables.  These structural properties have been designed and discovered by expert epidemiologists in order to try and logically infer if one variable causes another. It is important to identify causes of disease so that effective interventions can be designed to alleviate disease. 

MR can be seen as one logical concept for potentially inferring causation. It relies on principles that scientists have discovered and designed by hand (e.g. randomisation as a principle, and the discovery of naturally occurring randomisation in nature alongside the aforementioned graph properties). Epidemiologists working on methodological development would like to be able to refine and invent new tools in the same vein as MR, in order to broaden the scope of what can be studied and to provide variation in evidence of causation. This enables triangulation and synthesis of evidence meaning that the findings are robust and reliable. 

This research project will explore how modern AI methods can aid epidemiologists with methodological refinement and invention. The aim being to develop interactive tools that enable a symbiosis between the expert epidemiologist and modern AI methods that are able to search across a hypothesis space of useful methods. There is scope to use unique data resources that the IEU has collected and curated for example the MR-Base database, this data can be fused with state of the art AI methods that  combine symbolic and statistical/connectionist AI techniques. The use of symbolic AI is ideally suited for making logical inferences in complex structured data whereas statistical and connectionist AI techniques allow for fuzzy pattern matching. A concrete example of a line of research could be to see what kind of combination of AI techniques and data would allow for a system to reinvent MR without being given prior knowledge of its principles. This could potentially justify some of the principles and caveats that epidemiologists are aware of but more importantly could suggest potential so far unidentified refinements to the methodology.
